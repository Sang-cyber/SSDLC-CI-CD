     snyk-security-scan:
       stage: test
       script:
         - npm install -g snyk
         - snyk test
       only:
         - merge_requests
     ```

#### **Step 2.2**: API Token Setup

- Add your **Snyk API token** as a secret in your CI/CD tool (e.g., Jenkins credentials or GitLab CI variables).
- This token is required for authenticating your Snyk scans.

#### **Step 2.3**: Running Snyk Tests in CI/CD

- When code is pushed to the repository or a **pull/merge request** is created, the pipeline will automatically scan for vulnerabilities.
- Snyk will break the build if critical vulnerabilities are detected, ensuring no vulnerable code is merged or deployed.
  
Example Pipeline Output:
```
✗ High severity vulnerability found in node-fetch
  Description: Denial of Service (DoS)
  Remediation: Upgrade to version 2.6.1 or higher
  Build failed due to detected vulnerabilities.
```

### **3. Pre-Production Setup: Scanning Containers and IaC**

#### **Step 3.1**: Container Security Scanning with Docker

- Use **Snyk Container** to scan your **Docker images** before deploying to pre-prod or production.

1. In your CI/CD pipeline (Jenkins, GitLab, or GitHub Actions), add a Snyk container scan step:
   ```bash
   snyk container test <image_name>
   ```

2. Example for Jenkins:
   ```groovy
   pipeline {
     agent any
     stages {
       stage('Build Docker Image') {
         steps {
           sh 'docker build -t my-app .'
         }
       }
       stage('Snyk Container Scan') {
         steps {
           sh 'snyk container test my-app'
         }
       }
     }
   }
   ```

#### **Step 3.2**: Scan Infrastructure as Code (Terraform)

- Snyk can also scan **Terraform** or other IaC files for misconfigurations.

In the CI pipeline:
```bash
snyk iac test <path_to_terraform_file>
```

Example Output:
```
✗ Potentially unsafe default value for 'aws_security_group'
  Severity: High
  Path: security_group/main.tf
  Remediation: Remove open security groups or apply least-privilege principle
```

### **4. Production Setup: Continuous Monitoring**

#### **Step 4.1**: Continuous Monitoring in Production

- After deployment, you can use **Snyk’s continuous monitoring** to watch for new vulnerabilities in production systems.
- Set up **Snyk Monitor** in the CI/CD pipeline after a successful deployment:
   ```bash
   snyk monitor
   ```

- Snyk will continuously track the deployed application and alert you if new vulnerabilities are discovered in production.

#### **Step 4.2**: Automated Alerts and Fix Recommendations

- You’ll receive real-time alerts for new vulnerabilities, along with recommended fixes.
- Snyk can also be configured to automatically create **fix pull requests** to upgrade dependencies in your repository.

---

### **End-to-End Workflow**

1. **Development**:
   - Developers scan and fix vulnerabilities in real-time using **Snyk IDE** plugins in **VS Code** or **IntelliJ**.
   - Once vulnerabilities are fixed, code is committed and pushed to the repository.

2. **Testing**:
   - During the **CI/CD pipeline**, Snyk scans for vulnerabilities in dependencies, containers, and IaC files.
   - The build fails if critical vulnerabilities are detected, preventing insecure code from reaching staging or production.

3. **Pre-Production**:
   - **Docker images** and **Terraform configurations** are scanned using Snyk’s container and IaC security features.
   - Only secure images and infrastructure are promoted to production.

4. **Production**:
   - Once the application is deployed, **Snyk Monitor** continuously scans the application for new vulnerabilities.
   - Automated alerts and remediation suggestions are sent for any discovered vulnerabilities, helping maintain a secure production environment.

---

### **Outcome**:
By implementing this project, you ensure that security is embedded at every stage of the development lifecycle, from local development to production, using **Snyk**. Vulnerabilities are caught early, reducing the risk of exposure in production, while ensuring that security is automated and continuously monitored.
